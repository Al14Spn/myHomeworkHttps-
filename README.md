# Whalesay

The code in this repository is an adaption of the Linux `cowsay` game. The game was originally written in 1999 by Tony Monroe. The code in this repository came from the https://github.com/schacon/cowsay repository. 

This repository has two modifications not present in the original:

* the `default.cow` is now a Docker whale
* a `docker.cow` was added

This image is used in the Docker demo tutorial as a teaching tool.
